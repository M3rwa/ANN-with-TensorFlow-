# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with TensorFlow

This repository contains an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow. The ANN model is designed to solve a specific problem or task, which is described in the following sections.

## Problem Description

The specific problem addressed in this project is not mentioned in the repository. To understand the problem being solved by the ANN model, please refer to the provided notebook or documentation within the repository.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is not specified in the repository. It is recommended to refer to the notebook or documentation within the repository to obtain information about the dataset used and its structure.

## Requirements

To run the code and execute the ANN model, the following dependencies are required:

- TensorFlow: The deep learning framework used for building and training the ANN model.
- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment for running and modifying the notebook.

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip by running the following command:

```
pip install tensorflow jupyter
```

## Usage

To use the provided ANN model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the notebook (`ANN_with_TensorFlow.ipynb`) directly.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Requirements" section.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook on your machine using the command `jupyter notebook`.
4. Open the notebook (`ANN_with_TensorFlow.ipynb`) in your Jupyter Notebook interface.
5. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells and understand the different steps involved in training and evaluating the ANN model.
6. Modify and experiment with the code as desired to adapt it to your own problem or dataset.
